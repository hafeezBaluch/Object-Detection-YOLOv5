## Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv5.
- Detects multiple object classes.
- Customizable detection thresholds.
- Easy-to-run in Google Colab.

## Technologies Used
- YOLOv5: Object detection model.
- PyTorch: Framework for implementing YOLOv5.
- Google Colab: For cloud-based execution.
